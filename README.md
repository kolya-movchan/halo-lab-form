# TECHNOLOGIES:

To complete this project, I utilized the following technologies:

## Vite
Vite: The project was built using the Vite framework, which served as the template for development. Vite is a modern build tool that offers a fast and efficient development experience for JavaScript-based applications.

## React
I used React, a JavaScript library, to build the user interface and manage component-based architecture efficiently.

## TypeScript
I used TypeScript to define types, enums and interfaces for REST API data, and all the inner data. The type annotations and interfaces also enhanced code readability and made it easier to understand and maintain the project. Additionally, TypeScript's autocompletion and IDE support boosted productivity by providing accurate suggestions and documentation. With TypeScript, I gained confidence in the reliability and correctness of my codebase.

## JavaScript
JavaScript: I utilized JavaScript to handle various functionalities, such as making async functions, using then-catch constructions for error handling, and performing GET requests.

## SCSS
SCSS: It improves code maintainability and provides a more organized and efficient way of writing styles. By using SCSS, I could define reusable styles, reduce code duplication, and improve the organization of my stylesheets. SCSS's ability to nest selectors and use variables allowed for more modular and readable code. 

## React-Hook-Form
I used React Hook Form for managing forms in my project. It provides a lightweight and intuitive API for handling form validation, error messages, and form submission. By using React Hook Form, I was able to simplify the form management process and improve the overall user experience. It also offered performance optimizations, making it suitable for both small and large-scale applications. Additionally, React Hook Form promotes the use of uncontrolled components, reducing the need for manual state management and enhancing code readability.

## React-Toastify
For displaying notifications and providing feedback to users, I utilized React Toastify. It allowed me to easily show toast notifications such as success messages.

## Bulma
To style the user interface of my form, I chose to use Bulma, a modern CSS framework. Bulma provided a set of responsive and flexible components that helped me create a visually appealing and consistent UI. With its grid system, responsive design, and pre-built styling components, Bulma allowed me to quickly develop a well-structured and visually appealing form. Its modular and customizable nature made it easy to integrate into my project and adapt to my specific design requirements.

## Classnames Library
Classnames: I utilized classnames to manage dynamic class assignments based on specific conditions, enhancing the flexibility and readability of the code.

## Regex
I utilized regular expressions (Regex) to define and enforce specific validation patterns for the input fields in my form. By leveraging Regex, I was able to ensure that user input met certain requirements. By incorporating Regex, I enhanced the accuracy and reliability of the form data validation, resulting in a better user experience and preventing erroneous or malicious input.

## npm
npm: It allowed me to manage project dependencies and install various libraries and tools needed for the project.

## Prettier and ESLint
Prettier and ESLint: They help maintain consistent coding styles, catch potential errors, and improve code quality and readability.

## Git and GitHub
Git and GitHub: I used Git and GitHub to track and manage changes in the project, and host the project.

## Clean and Organized Code
Clean and Organized Code: The project followed a coding style that emphasized clean and well-organized code with proper indentation and consistent formatting. The code was structured in a logical and readable manner, making it easier for developers to understand and maintain. The project also employed naming conventions for variables, functions, and CSS classes. Consistent naming conventions helped in understanding the purpose and functionality of different code components. It promoted self-documenting code, reducing the need for excessive comments and making the codebase more comprehensible.

## Explanation Comments
Explanation Comments: The project incorporated explanation comments throughout the codebase to provide clarity and context for the implemented functionalities, complex logic, or any non-obvious code sections.
